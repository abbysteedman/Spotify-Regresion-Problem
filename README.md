# Spotify-Regresion-Problem
University Machine Learning Project

*Task* 
Your challenge is to build a good machine learning model that is able to predict the popularity of a song. Popularity is an integer value so treat this as a regression problem. Ignoring Id and Popularity (named "pop") there are 13 other attributes in the dataset that you may use to build your model. Use as many or as few of these as you like, but remember to spend time exploring, understanding and cleaning the data. The performance of the model will be determined by the RMSE.

The data is drawn from here: https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/spotify-past-decades-songs-50s10s. The only change that has been made is to the first column where "Number" has been re-named as "Id". Also note the points that "There are some missing values, and the year is not always coherent due to some re-releases etc."
